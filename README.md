## Maintenance
This repo contains 100% auto-generated code.  

🛑 IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES IN THE CODE DIRECTORY [onshape_rest_api_client](onshape_rest_api_client). 🛑 

Instead follow these instructions to regenerate the code using [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client):

1. go to a temporary directory, e.g.

```
cd /tmp
```

2. [install openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

3. run the generation command against onshape's openapi

```
openapi-python-client generate --url https://cad.onshape.com/api/openapi
```

4. replace the [onshape_rest_api_client](onshape_rest_api_client) directory with the new generated directory

5. compare existing [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file with the newly generated file, and update as necessary; note that the autogenerated version string is not compliant with PEP 440

6. replace [AUTOGENERATED_README.md](AUTOGENERATED_README.md) file with the newly auto-generated README.md file -- **NOTE THE NAME CHANGE**

7. update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with details of regeneration

8. update the `base_url` in the next section if changed


## Usage
