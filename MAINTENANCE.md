# Maintenance

This repo contains 100% auto-generated code! 

🛑 DO NOT MODIFY ANY AUTO-GENERATED FILES IN THE CODE DIRECTORY [onshape_rest_api_client](onshape_rest_api_client). 🛑 

Instead follow these instructions to regenerate the code using [openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client):


## Regenerate Code
1. go to a temporary directory, e.g.

```
cd /tmp
```

2. [install openapi-python-client](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

3. run the generation command against onshape's latest openapi specification

```
openapi-python-client generate --url https://cad.onshape.com/api/openapi
```

4. replace the [onshape_rest_api_client](onshape_rest_api_client) directory with the new generated directory

5. compare existing [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) file with the newly generated file, and update as necessary.  The version of this project tracks with the Onshape API version;  the autogenerated version string is not compliant with PEP 440 so it is truncated.  For example, replace `1.210.71816-ae322898e27a` with `1.210`.

7. update [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with details of regeneration

8. update the `base_url` in [README.md](README.md) if changed


## Building / publishing this package
This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and packaging.  Here are the basics to release to pypi:
1. When regenerating code, examine the dependencies of the auto-generated `pyproject.toml` and compare with [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml)
1. Build distribution files with `poetry build`
1. Publish to pypi with `poetry publish`
